<p> Goal is to help motivate people to challenge themselves while running
distances</p>
<p>Directed to:</p>
<blockquote>     Training Athletes</blockquote> 
<blockquote>     People who want to walk and see how far they are going</blockquote> 
<blockquote>     People who want to actively see their history on their physical activities</blockquote>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h3>

<p>I noticed that when I was training for Soccer that there was not an application that could motivate
me to train efficiently and effectively. I thought this would help athletes better train by themselves and keep
them motivated to work harder during on and off season.</p>

<a id="UseCase" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage Case Scenario</h3>

<p>Imagine, you are trying to train for a marathon. You want to start off by
running 1 mile, then build up to however miles you have to do. You
figure you need to run each mile in a certain amount of time. You use
this application by typing in a distance of how far you want to go and
how fast you want to attempt to do this in. The application will then 
start a ticker for the distance remaining as your running, as well as, 
calculating your speed and whether you need to pick up your pace or
continue at your pace. Once, you reach your final destination, it stores 
the information from the run including the path you took. This way you 
can look at how your runs have been going to see if your training has 
been successful.</p>
